## Profile
Hi, I'm Evangeline Chapman but you can call me Angie. I'm a second year public policy grad student with a concentration in community economic development. I currently intern with the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors, working on housing and homelessness issues.
## Description of UP221
The goal for this course is to expose you to the foundations of spatial data science. Our understanding of social phenomena through spatial constructs in urban data allows us to address location-based questions on social justice, the environment, transportation, community development and design, amongst many other themes, and how these factors may affect different population groups in different ways.
## Project Ideas and Objective
I would like to work on a project involving affordable housing or homelessness services in Los Angeles County.
